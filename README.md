2. **Environment Setup** - Prepare development environment
3. **Project Initialization** - Create Next.js project structure
4. **Begin Development** - Start Phase 1 implementation

## üìö YNAB API Integration ‚úÖ CONFIRMED FULLY SUPPORTED

This application integrates with the YNAB API v1:
- **Authentication**: Personal Access Token (for individual use)
- **Rate Limiting**: 200 requests per hour
- **Data Format**: JSON with milliunits for currency
- **Target Data**: ‚úÖ ALL goal/target fields confirmed available
- **Endpoints**: Budgets, categories, and monthly data with complete goal information
- **Historical Analysis**: ‚úÖ Month-by-month target data fully accessible

## üîß Development Requirements

- Node.js 18+ development environment
- YNAB account with API access
- Personal Access Token from YNAB
- Modern web browser for testing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd YNAB_Off_Target_Assignment
npm install
```

### 2. Configure YNAB API Access
1. **Get your YNAB Personal Access Token:**
   - Visit [YNAB Developer Settings](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer)
   - Click "New Token" and follow the instructions
   - Copy the generated token (format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

2. **Update Environment Variables:**
   - Open the `.env.local` file in the project root
   - Replace `your-ynab-personal-access-token-here` with your actual token:
   ```
   YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-actual-token-here
   ```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open Application
- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Verify the connection status shows "Connected to YNAB API"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Configuration Issues
- **"Missing required environment variables"**: Ensure `.env.local` exists and contains `YNAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- **"Invalid YNAB access token format"**: Token should be in format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
- **"Unable to connect to YNAB API"**: Verify your token is valid and has not expired

### Common Solutions
1. **Restart the development server** after changing environment variables
2. **Check token validity** by visiting YNAB Developer Settings
3. **Verify internet connection** for API access
