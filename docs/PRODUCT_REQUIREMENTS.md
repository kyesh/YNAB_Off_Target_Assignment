# YNAB Off-Target Assignment Analysis - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** YNAB Off-Target Assignment Analysis Tool  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  

### Purpose
A Next.js web application that integrates with the YNAB API to analyze budget target alignment, helping users understand how their monthly budget assignments compare against their predefined targets.

### Problem Statement
YNAB users often struggle to understand:
- How much of their monthly budget assignments align with their targets
- Which categories are receiving over-target funding
- Which categories receive funding but have no targets set
- Overall budget discipline and target adherence trends

### Solution Overview
A comprehensive dashboard and analysis tool that provides:
1. **Monthly Budget Analysis Dashboard** - High-level metrics and visualizations
2. **Detailed Drill-Down Views** - Category-level analysis and insights
3. **Historical Trend Analysis** - Track target alignment over time
4. **Actionable Insights** - Recommendations for budget optimization

## User Stories
