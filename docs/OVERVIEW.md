# YNAB Off-Target Assignment Analysis - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The YNAB Off-Target Assignment Analysis application is a comprehensive Next.js web application designed to integrate with the YNAB (You Need A Budget) API to provide detailed analysis of budget target alignment. This tool helps users understand how their monthly budget assignments compare against their predefined targets, offering insights into budget discipline and financial goal achievement.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Accurate Target Calculation**: Implement sophisticated logic to calculate "Needed This Month" values for all YNAB goal types
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provide detailed variance analysis showing over-target, under-target, and on-target categories
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive dashboard with debugging capabilities for transparency
4. **Real-time Integration**: Connect directly with YNAB API for up-to-date budget data
5. **Educational Value**: Help users understand their budgeting patterns and improve financial discipline

### Success Metrics

- **Calculation Accuracy**: 100% alignment with YNAB's internal calculations
- **Performance**: Dashboard loads within 3 seconds
- **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage with comprehensive test suite
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal learning curve
- **Reliability**: Zero critical bugs in production environment

## Key Features

### Smart Calculation Engine

The application implements a sophisticated 7-rule calculation system:

1. **Zero-Target Strategy**: Categories without goals → $0
2. **Rule 6**: Future goal creation → $0 (goals created after analysis month)
3. **Rule 1**: Monthly NEED goals → `goal_target`
4. **Rule 2**: Weekly NEED goals → `goal_target × day_occurrences`
5. **Rule 3**: Months to budget → `(goal_overall_left + budgeted) ÷ months_remaining`
6. **Rule 5**: Low months to budget → $0 (completed/overdue goals)
7. **Rule 4**: All other cases → `goal_target`

### Interactive Dashboard

- **Monthly Overview**: Income, activity, budgeted amounts, and variance summaries
