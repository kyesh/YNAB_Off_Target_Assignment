# 🎯 **YNAB Variance Calculation - Simplified Solution Summary**

**Date**: December 2024
**Status**: ✅ **SIMPLIFIED AND IMPLEMENTED**
**Impact**: Streamlined accuracy with reduced complexity

---

## 🚨 **The Evolution: From Complex to Simple**

### **Previous Problem**

Our YNAB budget analysis tool had overly complex dual-field logic that attempted to handle every edge case, making it difficult to maintain and understand.

### **Simplified Solution**

Replaced complex methodology with four clear, definitive rules that cover all practical YNAB scenarios while maintaining accuracy.

### **Real Examples of the Issue**

**Before Fix:**

- **Internet**: Assigned $34.67 / Remaining $0.82 = **4,228% over-target** ❌
- **Water**: Assigned $63.34 / Remaining $15.00 = **422% over-target** ❌
- **Gas**: Assigned $100.00 / Remaining $7.08 = **1,312% over-target** ❌

**After Fix:**

- **Internet**: Assigned $34.67 / Target $51.00 = **68% of target** ✅
- **Water**: Assigned $63.34 / Target $235.00 = **27% of target** ✅
- **DTE/Consumer**: Assigned $180.12 / Target $400.00 = **45% of target** ✅

## 🔍 **Fundamental Understanding Corrected**

### **`goal_target` Meaning by Goal Type**

| Goal Type          | `goal_target` Represents         | Conversion Needed                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **MF**             | Monthly funding amount           | None ✅                              |
| **NEED (Weekly)**  | Weekly amount                    | × 52 ÷ 12 = monthly                  |
| **NEED (Yearly)**  | Yearly amount                    | ÷ 12 = monthly                       |
| **NEED (Monthly)** | Amount per frequency period      | ÷ frequency = monthly                |
| **TB/TBD/DEBT**    | Total target or monthly progress | Use goal_under_funded when available |

### **`goal_under_funded` Behavior**

- **Represents**: Amount still needed to reach goal (remaining, not original)
- **Dynamic**: Decreases as user assigns money during the month
- **Limitation**: Returns `null` for future-dated NEED goals
- **Usage**: Perfect for funding guidance, problematic for variance calculations

---

## ✅ **The Simplified Solution: Four Clear Rules**

### **Core Implementation**

```typescript
// Single function with four definitive rules
const neededThisMonth = calculateNeededThisMonth(category, currentMonth);

// Use for both variance calculations and display
const variance = assigned - neededThisMonth;
const percentage = (assigned / neededThisMonth) * 100;
```

### **Four Simplified Rules**

1. **Rule 1: Monthly NEED Goals** (`cadence=1, frequency=1`)

   - Use `goal_target` directly as monthly amount

2. **Rule 2: Weekly NEED Goals** (`cadence=2, frequency=1`)

   - Calculate `goal_target × count_of_goal_day_in_month`

3. **Rule 3: Goals with Months to Budget** (priority rule)

   - Use `(goal_overall_left + budgeted) ÷ goal_months_to_budget`

4. **Rule 4: All Other Cases** (fallback)
   - Use `goal_target` for MF, TB, TBD, DEBT goals

## 📊 **Simplified Validation Results**

### **Rule-Based Calculation Examples**

**Monthly Subscription (Rule 1)**:

- Goal: `goal_target=60000` ($60/month), `cadence=1`, `frequency=1`
- Calculation: Use goal_target directly = **$60/month** ✅
- Result: Simple, accurate monthly amount

**Weekly Groceries (Rule 2)**:

- Goal: `goal_target=100000` ($100/occurrence), `cadence=2`, `goal_day=1` (Monday)
- December 2024: 5 Mondays
- Calculation: $100 × 5 = **$500/month** ✅
- Result: Accurate monthly amount based on actual calendar

**Vacation Fund (Rule 3)**:

- Goal: `goal_months_to_budget=6`, `goal_overall_left=100000`, `budgeted=20000`
- Calculation: (100000 + 20000) ÷ 6 = **$20/month** ✅
- Result: Precise monthly funding requirement

**Monthly Bills (Rule 4)**:

- Goal: `goal_type=MF`, `goal_target=250000` ($250/month)
- Calculation: Use goal_target directly = **$250/month** ✅
- Result: Straightforward fallback for standard goals

## 🔧 **Simplified Technical Implementation**

### **Single Function Approach**

```typescript
export function calculateNeededThisMonth(
  category: YNABCategory,
  currentMonth?: string
): number | null {
  // Rule 3: Goals with months to budget take precedence
  if (category.goal_months_to_budget && category.goal_months_to_budget > 0) {
    const overallLeft = category.goal_overall_left || 0;
    const budgeted = category.budgeted || 0;
    return Math.round(
      (overallLeft + budgeted) / category.goal_months_to_budget
    );
  }

  // Rule 1: Monthly NEED Goals
  if (category.goal_cadence === 1 && category.goal_cadence_frequency === 1) {
    return category.goal_target;
  }

  // Rule 2: Weekly NEED Goals
  if (
    category.goal_cadence === 2 &&
    category.goal_cadence_frequency === 1 &&
    typeof category.goal_day === 'number'
  ) {
    const dayCount = countDayOccurrencesInMonth(year, month, category.goal_day);
    return Math.round(category.goal_target * dayCount);
  }

  // Rule 4: All other cases
  return category.goal_target;
}
```

### **Simplified Data Structure**

```typescript
interface ProcessedCategory {
  // ... existing fields
  neededThisMonth: number | null; // Single calculation result
  target: number | null; // Alias for backward compatibility
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **Backward Compatibility**

- `extractTargetAmount()` now calls `calculateNeededThisMonth()`
- Existing API endpoints continue to work unchanged
- Removed complex dual-field approach
