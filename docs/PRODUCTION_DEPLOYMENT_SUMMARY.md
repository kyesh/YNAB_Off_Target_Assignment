- **Security**: PKCE, encrypted token storage, automatic refresh
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks for complete implementation

**Key Features**:

- Multi-user support with isolated data
- Secure token management with encryption
- Automatic token refresh without user intervention
- Backward compatibility during migration

### 2. PostHog Analytics Integration

**File**: `docs/POSTHOG_ANALYTICS_PLAN.md`

**Comprehensive Analytics Strategy**:

- User behavior tracking (budget selections, debug usage, calculations)
- Performance monitoring (API response times, page load speeds)
- Privacy-compliant data collection with consent management
- Custom analytics dashboard for product insights

**Privacy Features**:

- GDPR/CCPA compliant data collection
- User consent management with granular controls
- Data anonymization and retention policies
- Opt-out mechanisms for all analytics

### 3. Google Cloud Platform Deployment

**File**: `docs/GCP_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`

**Architecture Decision**: Cloud Run (Recommended over App Engine)

- **Benefits**: Better Next.js support, cost-effective scaling, container flexibility
