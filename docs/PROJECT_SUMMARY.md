## Data Models and Processing

### YNAB Data Integration
The application processes several key YNAB data structures:
- **Budget Objects**: Basic budget information and metadata
- **Category Objects**: Category details including targets and assignments
- **Month Objects**: Monthly budget data with category assignments
- **Category Groups**: Organizational structure for categories

### Analysis Calculations
- **Target Alignment Status**: Categorize assignments as on-target, over-target, under-target, or no-target
- **Variance Calculations**: Calculate differences between assignments and targets
- **Percentage Analysis**: Determine what percentage of budget aligns with targets
- **Summary Statistics**: Generate monthly and category-level insights

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: Validate YNAB Personal Access Token
2. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch budget and category data from YNAB API
3. **Processing**: Calculate target alignment and generate analysis
4. **Caching**: Store responses temporarily to minimize API calls
5. **Visualization**: Present results through interactive dashboard
